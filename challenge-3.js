function netSalaryCalculator(){ //function for calculating the net Salary
    let grossPay= 800000; // initializes the net Salary   //initializes the basic Salary
    let benefits= 61400; // initializes the benefits
    let rateOfTax = 0.325 // initializes the rate of tax
    let tax = grossPay * rateOfTax; //calculates the rate of tax from the gross salary 
    const netSalary = (grossPay - benefits - tax); //calculates what the salary will be after the tax and benefits deductions 
 return netSalary
}
console.log(netSalaryCalculator())
